## Development

### go.mod replacements

When you work on packages that require changes in the core you will need:

```bash
go-task mod-replace
```

This will add replace statements to all go.mod's in this repo.

**Before** a git commit you have to:

```bash
go-task mod-dropreplace
```

We do not accept commit's with a "replace" line.

### Quirks
